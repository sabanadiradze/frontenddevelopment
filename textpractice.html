    <p>Aziz Sergeyevich Shavershian[2] (Russian: Ази́з Серге́евич Шавершя́н; 24 March 1989 – 5 August 2011),[3] better
        known as Zyzz,[4][5] was a Russian-born Australian bodybuilder, personal trainer and model. He established a
        cult following after posting multiple videos of himself on YouTube, starting in 2007.[6][7][8]

        <span class="month  "> July 2011 </span>, Shavershian gained more media attention when The Sydney Morning Herald
        published an article about
        the arrest of his older brother, Said, for illegal possession of anabolic steroids.[9] On 5 August 2011, while
        on holiday in Thailand, Aziz suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 22.[4][10]

    <p>Before becoming a bodybuilder, Shavershian had been described as a "skinny kid"[7][18] and an ectomorph.[19] Once
        he completed secondary school,[12] inspired by his bodybuilder brother, he joined a local gym and began learning
        about nutrition and training, applying it to his pursuit of becoming a bodybuilder. He would spend three to four
        hours a day training in the gym.[19][20] His favourite professional bodybuilders included Arnold Schwarzenegger
        and Frank Zane.[19]

        In an interview with bodybuilding website Simplyshredded.com, Shavershian recalled that he originally wanted to
        become a bodybuilder to "impress girls". He said he would look at pictures of "shredded" bodybuilders and tell
        himself that he would one day be like them. Almost four years into training, he stated that:
        I can safely say that my motivation to train goes far beyond that of merely impressing people, it is derived
        from the feeling of having set goals and achieving them and outdoing myself in the gym. I absolutely love it,
        the feeling of pushing out that last rep, and getting skin tearing pumps is something I don't see myself
        without.[19]

        Shavershian was the poster boy of a subculture of amateur bodybuilding in Australia, dubbed "aesthetics",[21]
        which he had made popular.[20] He had established his own protein label, Protein of the Gods, released in June
        2011.[6] He also had a clothing line,[22] and Zyzz's Bodybuilding Bible was released on 17 May 2011, based on a
        compilation of bodybuilding knowledge he had acquired over his four years of training.[18][23] He asserted that
        the internet helped build up his brand, and it was ultimately made possible through the use of social media.[24]

        On 14 July 2011, Shavershian's brother Said was arrested for possession of anabolic steroids,[9] to which he
        pleaded guilty after Aziz's death.[2][25] The Sydney Morning Herald covered the case, and included a photo of
        Shavershian.[9] He objected to the use of his picture to illustrate what was essentially an article on the
        misuse of anabolic steroids.[18]

        When asked by The Daily Telegraph, Shavershian denied ever using steroids, and claimed that his physique was the
        result of hard work in the gym and a strict diet.[23] According to The Sydney Morning Herald, the company which
        employed Shavershian as a stripper maintained that he was "a lovely guy, aside from the steroids".[26]
        Shavershian often used phrases such as "riding bicycles", which, according to The Daily Telegraph, is "gym slang
        for using a cycle of steroids".[13]</p>
